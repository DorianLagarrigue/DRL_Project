# DRL_Project
Deep Reinforcement Learning project with Python and Unity. The goal is for one or more agents to learn how to play a video game

There is not all the project in master branch. There are only files thats are interesting for the machine learning algorithm.
Some words and comments are in french because at the beginning I didn't know that I will post it on my github.
This project is not finished yet, there are more things I have to change and add in the future.
